    <h3><strong> Prostitution Meaning </strong></h3>
    Prostitution comes from Latin and means: Placing in front
    <em>(pro is upfront and otatuere means placement).</em>

      Sex work is not the oldest profession in the world; anthropologists have
      found no evidence of selling sex within numerous (so called) primitive
      societies. The northern hill tribes of Thailand had no word for
      prostitution, and Victorian explorers were surprised to discover that the
      Dyak people of Borneo had no word to express that vice, and when Christian
      missionary, Lorrin Andrews, translated the bible into Hawaiian in 1865, he
      had to invent new words to teach the islanders about the concept of sexual
      shame, and infidelity. But, wherever you find money, you also find sex
      work.

      Whore is an old Indo-European word, related to the Old Indian word Kama
      (like in Kamasutra) meaning lust. Historically, levied at any women who
      stepped outside the norms of modest behaviour that upset the status quo.
      Whore originally derives from the Germanic horon meaning “one that
      desires.
    </p>
    <p> In old Norwegian the word is hora (adulteress woman). In Dutch its called:
      “hoer” and is almost pronounced the same way as the English word whore.</p>

      A brothel is a place where people can go to engage in sexual activity with
      prostitutes. It is illegal in many countries around the world, but it
      still exists in some form in many places.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some cases, brothels are run by organized crime groups and offer a wide
      range of services, including drugs and other illegal activities. In other
      cases, brothels are simply places where people can pay for sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      The legality of brothels varies from country to country, and even from
      state to state. In some places, brothels are considered to be a form of
      business, while in others they are seen as a form of exploitation. There
      is much debate over the morality of brothels, and whether or not they
      should be legalized.
